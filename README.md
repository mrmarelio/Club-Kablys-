# Club-Kablys-
My second and third semester course work. Created a design for a club and later on added functionality to it: sign up and log in pages, ticket purchasing and an admin page.

RUNNING THE PROJECT
1. Create a database with the name "kablys" and upload the "kablys.sql" file.
2. Upload all of the files to a PHP development environment (e.g. XAMPP) and run it.
